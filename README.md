Different asymmetric algorithms like RSA provides
security but RSA-OAEP scheme(RSA with OAEP padding) gives an extra benefits by adding some randomness to the scheme.
Similarly, another asymmetric encryption algorithm ElGamal encryption tool also provides security during transmission but the
different cryptographic attacks encroach the security and making it insecure altogether. In this paper, a novel methodology has
been proposed, in which the plain-text is being encrypted with ElGamal encryption technique after padding it using Optimal
Asymmetric Encryption Padding(OAEP) scheme. Before encryption, padding the plaintext with OAEP padding technique using
the hashing function BLAKE2b is being formulated. This method makes the encryption and decryption procedures much faster
than the usual encryption/decryption using conventional ElGamal scheme. With the increase of plain-text file size, encryption or
decryption time of the proposed methodology increases very slowly. The proposed scheme is secure under the chosen-plaintext
attack(IND-CPA) and also solves the problem of 1-bit information leakage present in the ElGamal encryption system.
